                <p>Smart contract of a ERC20 token, connected to UI, allows users to effect token transfers between addresses and with other functions, including staking, which pays rewards based on the sum blocked by the user.
                  This type of smart contract is part of decentralized finance, that can create possibilities for the investors to transform their own currency in digital currency, being able to get rewards too. This allows you to deny centralization and to absorb inflation</p>
